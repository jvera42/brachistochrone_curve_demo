# Brachistochrone Curve Demo
Brachistochrone Curve Demo Materials

Includes:
- Code for Arduino UNO Development board.
  - This code reads in inputs from four triggers. The first trigger is the race control button, which starts the race, controls race flow, and resets the system upon race finish or system interrupt. The next three triggers are switches that each ball hits at the end of its track to stop the individual track timer. When each timer is stopped, the code then compares all the times, and prints out the fastest time to a connect LCD display.
- Circuit Block Diagram for Arduino, LCD display, and button/switch configurations.
